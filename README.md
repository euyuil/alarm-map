Alarm Map
=========

This is an app that can wake you up when you're at particular locations.


Where does the name come from?
------------------------------

You must know something named **alarm clock**, where **clock** means something you can learn the
time from, and when it's at particular time, this thing will **alarm**.

So, **alarm map** is just like that. You can learn where you are from a **map**. And if you need
something to **alarm** you up when you're at some particular location, **alarm map** is what you
need.


Is this useful?
---------------

Well, I came up the idea when I was on the shuttle bus. As a developer I usually get exhausted
after work (poor developers) and I sleep on the shuttle bus. Sometimes I might fall asleep and
skip the bus stop where I should get off.

So if you have the same problem as I do, you will find it useful.
